# IAC - ImprovedAntiCheat for EZ
Forked from the GCD AntiCheat. This anti cheat uses the Scripting API, however it uses some features specific to ElementZero, so it cannot (in the current state) be used in an addon.

Simply drop the `scripts` folder into EZ's root directory, and enable `ScriptingSupport` in `custom.yaml`.
